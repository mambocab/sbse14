Whoo!

> What have we here?

This is Jim Witschey's repo for his Search-Based Software Engineering class with Dr. Tim Menzies.

> Um. What's `witschey`?

Glad you asked! `witschey` is a little directory full of goodies based on [Dr. Tim Menzies' utilities](https://github.com/timm/sbse14). To test it, first,

```zsh
pip install nose
```

then, 

```zsh
cd witschey
nosetests
```
