"""## Non-Parametric Hypothesis Testing

The following _bootstrap_ method was introduced in
1979 by Bradley Efron at Stanford University. It
was inspired by earlier work on the
jackknife.
Improved estimates of the variance were [developed later][efron01].  

[efron01]: http://goo.gl/14n8Wf "Bradley Efron and R.J. Tibshirani. An Introduction to the Bootstrap (Chapman & Hall/CRC Monographs on Statistics & Applied Probability), 1993"


To check if two populations _(y0,z0)_
are different, many times sample with replacement
from both to generate _(y1,z1), (y2,z2), (y3,z3)_.. etc.

Then, for all those samples,
 check if some *testStatistic* in the original pair
hold for all the other pairs. If it does more than (say) 99%
of the time, then we are 99% confident in that the
populations are the same.

In such a _bootstrap_ hypothesis test, the *some property*
is the difference between the two populations, muted by the
joint standard deviation of the populations.

"""

The rest is just details:

+ Efron advises
  to make the mean of the populations the same (see
  the _yhat,zhat_ stuff shown below).

## Saner Hypothesis Testing

The following code, which you should use verbatim does the following:


+ All treatments are clustered into _ranks_. In practice, dozens
  of treatments end up generating just a handful of ranks.
+ The numbers of calls to the hypothesis tests are minimized:
    + Treatments are sorted by their median value.
    + Treatments are divided into two groups such that the
      expected value of the mean values _after_ the split is minimized;
    + Hypothesis tests are called to test if the two groups are truly difference.
          + All hypothesis tests are non-parametric and include (1) effect size tests
            and (2) tests for statistically significant numbers;
          + Slow bootstraps are executed  if the faster _A12_ tests are passed;

In practice, this means that the hypothesis tests (with confidence of say, 95%)
are called on only a logarithmic number of times. So...

+ With this method, 16 treatments can be studied using less than _&sum;<sub>1,2,4,8,16</sub>log<sub>2</sub>i =15_ hypothesis tests  and confidence _0.99<sup>15</sup>=0.86_.
+ But if did this with the 120 all-pairs comparisons of the 16 treatments, we would have total confidence _0.99<sup>120</sup>=0.30.

For examples on using this code, see _rdivDemo_ (below).
