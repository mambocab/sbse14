In my test of MaxWalkSat for the Fonseca model, the algorighm converged on a
value below my threshold faster when local search was more likely.
This indicates that the output of the model varies greatly along each input
variable -- exploring the full space of one variable finds minima more
effectively than exploring all of them simultaneously.
